      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and brought up MCU-based sensor test and data-collection platforms to evaluate
          next-generation MEMS inertial sensors at sampling rates exceeding 12.8 kHz. The platform
          was developed for internal characterization and validation workflows and emphasized
          flexibility, throughput, and measurement integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the proprietary nature of this work, implementation details and hardware artifacts
          cannot be publicly disclosed.

        <p>
          The platform centered around an MCU-based architecture with onboard memory and DMA-driven
          data acquisition pipelines. Multiple communication interfaces were implemented to support
          flexible integration with laboratory equipment and automated test setups.
