      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and implemented a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) laser projection system capable of
          rendering static shapes and dynamic animations. The system combines embedded firmware,
          digital signal decoding, and closed-loop motor control to accurately steer a laser beam
          in two axes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project emphasized real-time control, feedback processing, and end-to-end system
          integration across hardware and software boundaries.
        </p>

      <!-- SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>System Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          The system consists of two motor-driven axes controlling the laser’s horizontal and vertical
          position. An embedded microcontroller executes the control loop, while quadrature encoders
          provide position feedback. The controller computes actuation commands using a PID control
          law to track desired trajectories.
        </p>

          <li>Two-axis actuation with quadrature encoder feedback</li>
          <li>SPI communication with external digital logic for decoding and timing</li>

      <!-- HARDWARE -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hardware Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          A custom mechanical assembly was designed to mount the laser and actuators, providing
          stable and repeatable motion. Encoder feedback enables precise measurement of shaft position
          and velocity, which is essential for closed-loop control.

      <!-- CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Control and Signal Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Quadrature encoder signals are decoded to determine position and direction of motion.
          The decoded position is fed into a discrete-time PID controller implemented on the ESP32.
          Controller gains were tuned experimentally to balance responsiveness, stability, and
          tracking accuracy.

      <!-- RESULTS -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Results and Demonstration</h3>
        <p>
          The system successfully projected a variety of shapes and animations by following
          time-varying reference trajectories. Stable closed-loop behavior was achieved after
          controller tuning, with minimal overshoot and consistent tracking across both axes.
        </p>

          A short demonstration video captures the system projecting dynamic patterns in real time.
