      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and simulated a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier in a 45 nm process using Cadence Virtuoso.
          The design consists of a fully differential first stage with common-mode feedback (CMFB), followed by
          a common-source second stage to achieve high gain and wide bandwidth under strict stability constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amplifier was verified through DC operating point analysis, open- and closed-loop frequency response,
          and large-signal transient simulations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- ARCHITECTURE -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          The op-amp employs a two-stage topology. The first stage is a fully differential input pair that provides
          the majority of the voltage gain while enabling high common-mode rejection. A dedicated CMFB circuit
          stabilizes the output common-mode voltage of the differential stage. The second stage is a single-ended
          common-source amplifier that boosts gain and drives the load.
        </p>

      <!-- BIASING AND OPERATING POINTS -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Biasing and DC Operating Points</h3>
        <p>
          DC operating point analysis was performed to ensure all transistors operate in the intended region
          across the amplifier core and CMFB circuitry. Proper biasing is critical for achieving the desired
          small-signal parameters and maintaining linear operation.

          Extracted device parameters such as transconductance and output resistance were used to validate
          hand calculations and confirm consistency with theoretical expectations.

      <!-- AC ANALYSIS -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Small-Signal Frequency Response</h3>
        <p>
          Small-signal AC analysis was used to evaluate the open-loop gain, unity-gain bandwidth, and phase margin.
          The open-loop response confirms sufficient DC gain and dominant pole behavior, while the closed-loop
          response verifies stability when configured as a voltage follower.
        </p>

        <p>
          The amplifier achieves approximately <strong>47.5 dB DC gain</strong>,
          a <strong>616 MHz unity-gain bandwidth</strong>, and a
          <strong>61° phase margin</strong>, satisfying the design targets.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Transient and Large-Signal Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Transient simulations were performed to assess large-signal behavior, including slew rate,
          settling time, and stability under step inputs. These simulations confirm that the amplifier
          remains stable and well-damped during dynamic operation.
