      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and simulated a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier in a 45 nm process using
          Cadence Virtuoso. The design targets high open-loop gain, wide unity-gain bandwidth,
          and stable closed-loop operation under tight power and loading constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amplifier consists of a fully differential first stage with common-mode feedback (CMFB),
          followed by a single-ended second stage. Performance was verified through DC operating
          point analysis, small-signal frequency response, and large-signal transient simulations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- TOPOLOGY -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Overall Topology</h3>
        <p>
          The selected architecture is a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier. The fully differential
          first stage provides high gain and common-mode rejection, while an explicit CMFB loop
          stabilizes the output common-mode voltage. A common-source second stage increases output
          swing and drives the load.
        </p>

        <p>
          This topology enables high DC gain while maintaining sufficient phase margin when
          configured in a unity-gain feedback configuration.

      <!-- SCHEMATIC -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Circuit Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          The complete transistor-level schematic was implemented in Cadence Virtuoso using
          low-voltage threshold devices. Careful device sizing and biasing were employed to
          achieve the desired transconductance, output resistance, and pole locations.
        </p>

      <!-- BIASING -->
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Biasing and DC Operating Points</h3>
        <p>
          DC operating point analysis was performed to verify that all transistors operate in
          the intended region of operation. Correct biasing is essential to ensure linearity,
          predictable small-signal behavior, and robustness to process variation.
        </p>

          Extracted small-signal parameters such as transconductance and output resistance were
          compared against hand calculations to validate design assumptions.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Small-Signal Frequency Response</h3>
        <p>
          Small-signal AC simulations were used to evaluate open-loop gain, pole-zero placement,
          unity-gain bandwidth, and phase margin. The open-loop response confirms dominant-pole
          behavior and sufficient DC gain.

          The amplifier achieves approximately <strong>47.5 dB DC gain</strong>,
          a <strong>616 MHz unity-gain bandwidth</strong>, and a
          <strong>61° phase margin</strong>, meeting the specified stability requirements.

        <h3>Transient and Large-Signal Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Large-signal transient simulations were performed to evaluate slew rate, settling
          behavior, and overall dynamic stability. The amplifier exhibits well-damped responses
          to step inputs without oscillation.
